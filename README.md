  <summary>:speech_balloon:My favourite quote:heavy_exclamation_mark:</summary>
<br>"Be ashamed to die until you have scor victory for humanity. Victory of humanilty not for yourself,  but humanlity is better off. Have I lessened the suffering of others. Or have I enhanced the life of others. Even a small gesture that add value to someone's life, I'm going to do it. Small mins of my life into the happiness or enlightenment or the reduced suffering of someone else. I'd be irresponsible if I did not."</br>

<br>"It is not about people praising you, is about what do you have to give with no expectation of return."</br>

~ Neil DeGrasse Tyson
